# Apex Global Enterprise Network Infrastructure Project

## 🏢 Executive Architecture Overview
This repository houses the complete production-grade network infrastructure design for Apex Global. The architecture features a dual-site deployment bridging a high-performance corporate headquarters in **New York (NYC-HQ)** with a regional satellite office in **Toronto (YYZ-BR)** over a dedicated cross-country WAN point-to-point transit link. 

The entire framework was designed using a **Top-Down Backbone-First Model** to guarantee absolute stability, deterministic routing boundaries, and isolated fault domains.

## 🛠️ Core Infrastructure Stack & Technologies Used
* **Layer 3 Core Routing**: Cisco IOS 2911 Inter-Site WAN Processing, Static/Summary routing protocols, Gateway of Last Resort engineering.
* **Multi-Layer Switching**: Cisco 3560 Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs), native Layer 3 hardware routing, inter-VLAN distribution.
* **Automated Network Services**: Multi-pool Cisco IOS DHCP engines, isolated infrastructure exclusions, DHCP Option 150 voice parameter targeting.
* **Unified Communications (VoIP)**: Cisco CallManager Express (CME) software integration, global telephony service engines, auto-registration matrices.
* **Layer 2 Edge Protection**: 802.1Q encapsulation trunking, VTP Domain isolation, Spanning-Tree PortFast, and edge BPDU Guard enforcement.

## 🤖 Collaboration & Engineering Methodology
This infrastructure was designed and validated using an advanced interactive engineering model. 
* **Lead Network Architect**: [Naeem/Thr0na] — Hand-coded all Cisco IOS router scripts, Layer 3 SVI configurations, switch port range mappings, and handled all live network troubleshooting.
* **AI Collaborator Engine**: Used to mimic real-world senior code audits, verify configuration syntax constraints against Cisco exam blueprints, and format the technical project documentation into a standardized Markdown structure.
